# RSASecureX 🔒

Extended-Precision Cryptography Toolkit using C#

## 📚 Project Overview
RSASecureX is a complete implementation of the RSA public-key cryptosystem using a custom-built BigInteger class to handle large integers (hundreds of digits).  
Built using C# and .NET for educational purposes.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- `BigIntegerLib/` — Custom BigInteger class (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, odd/even check)
- `RSACrypto/` — RSA encryption and decryption operations
- `RSASecureX/` — Console app for handling input/output files and execution timing

## 📦 How to Run
```bash
dotnet build
cd RSASecureX
dotnet run
